# Life Expectancy Predictive Modelling

This is a Life Expectancy Predictive Modelling Project using data from the World Health Organisation.

Project Scope:

* Life expectancy is a statistical measure used to estimate an individual's lifespan. 
* On an individual level, life expectancy is crucial in determining one's plans, support and care. 
* On a large group level, it holds paramount socio-economical implications.
* On a country level, it is used to derive insights, analytics and further studies to better understand the needs and risk factors of populations.

Project Goals:

* Provide an estimated prediction of life expectancies across countries on the globe.
* One model should use the least information necessary to mitigate some countries' concerns about sharing their sensitive data.
* A second, more elaborate model, that can be used if states decide to share more data
* Part of the task will be to use our judgment as ethical data practitioners to determine which features should be used.

Technologies Used:
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciKitLearn, StatsModels
* Tools: JupyterLabs, GoogleColab
